# MCT-Grasp
MCT-Grasp: A Novel Grasp Detection using  Multimodal Embedding and Convolutional  Modulation Transformer

# FrameWork
![FrameWork](./src/imgs/MCT-Grasp-framework.png)

# Run
## 1. test network
We have released the network code of MCT-Grasp, in which you can see the implementation process of the network. 

```python
python experiments/main.py
```

The other codes are still being sorted out and we will update them as soon as possible.

## 2. note

The MCT-Grasp platform is common to [GRCNN](https://github.com/skumra/robotic-grasping). 

If you want to quickly use MCT-Grasp for training and testing, **you can put the MCT.py into the ```inference/models/``` directory of GRCNN, adjust the relevant paths and references, and run it directly.**


# Experiment
We provide a video of the experiments: [Grasp-Video](https://youtu.be/5y6ALxQEtWk)
